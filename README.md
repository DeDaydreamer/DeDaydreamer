# 👋 Hi, I'm Aleks

**Technical founder & self-taught systems builder.**  
I build the software, tools, APIs, and workflows behind **DeDynamics** — a small creative-tech ecosystem for local creators, small businesses, and DePIN projects.

I’m not a formally trained developer. I learn each stack by building real projects end-to-end, versioning everything on GitHub (since recently when I decided to do it as it should be done with no shortcuts), and debugging until it works.

I work in a hybrid way:  
- I design the system, flows, and requirements  
- I use AI to help write and refactor code (AI augumented flow) 
- I debug, iterate, and ship until it’s usable in the real world
- After I learn my stack I code myself more 

I don't use no-code builders, no shortcuts.

##  What I build

- **Internal tools & APIs** – logging, “Brain” storage, RAG, and small automations for my company  
- **AI-assisted workflows** – custom GPT/LLM-based agents, assistants that support real operations and integrations  
- **Web & infra experiments** – Cloudflare Workers, static and dynamic sites, small backends, integrations

Most of my repos start as things I genuinely need. I identify a problem, sketch a solution, then learn whatever is required to make it work.

##  How I work with AI

- I **don’t** paste random code and hope for the best  
- I **do** treat AI like a pair programmer:  
  - I describe what I want  
  - It proposes code  
  - I adjust, test, and debug until I understand it
  - I ask a lot of stupid questions until the chat is annoyed with my low-skillness. :-) 

Each project teaches me more, so over time I write more of the code myself.

##  Selected areas I'm exploring

- Cloudflare Workers, AutoRAG, Pages & serverless APIs  
- KV / storage-backed “brain” systems for logging & agents  
- AI-assisted automation for small businesses  
- Git-based workflows and documentation for non-technical users

##  Collaboration & feedback

If you’re passing by and you:

- See something that could be improved  
- Want to ask how I built something  
- Have advice on better patterns / architecture  

…feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or just say hi.

I’m always learning, and I genuinely appreciate constructive feedback. I'm always honoured to learn from real devs.
