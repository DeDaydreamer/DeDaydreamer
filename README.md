# Hi, I'm Aleks

**Technical founder & self-taught systems builder.**  
I learn by building, debugging, and shipping — no shortcuts, no no-code.

I'm a **recovering addict** who spent **two years homeless**. Today I'm **2 years clean**, rebuilding my life by building **DeDynamics.pro**: a small creative-tech studio helping local businesses use modern tools, AI workflows, automation, and real problem-solving.

### What I do
- Build small tools, APIs, and “brains” (storage-backed systems)  
- Create AI agents & operational automations  
- Develop static/dynamic sites and simple backends  
- Help local businesses understand and adopt new tech

### How I work
- I identify the problem → research → design → build → debug → ship  
- I use AI as a pair programmer, not a code machine  
- I learn each stack by working on real problems

### My projects
- **DeDynamics.pro** — creative-tech studio  
- **The Daydreamverse Blog** — writing about recovery & understanding  
- **AleksDubowski.pro** — personal site
